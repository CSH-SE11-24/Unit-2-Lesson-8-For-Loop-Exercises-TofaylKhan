// Task 1: Print Numbers
// Write a JavaScript program that uses a for loop to print all num from 1-10

for (let i = 1; i <10; i+=1){
  console.log(i)
}
  



// Task 2: Odd Numbers
// Write a JavaScript program that uses a for loop to print all odd numbers from 15 to 40 to the console.
for (let i = 15; i <40; i+=2){
  console.log(i)
}



// Task 3: Sum of Numbers
// Write a JavaScript program that calculates and prints the sum of all numbers from 10 to 20 using a for loop.

for (let i = 10; i<20;i++){
  
}




// Task 4: Array Iteration
// Create an array of numbers (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) and write a JavaScript program that uses a for loop to iterate through the array and print each element to the console
let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,]
for (let i = 0; )





// Task 5: Array Sum
// Create an array of numbers and write a JavaScript program that calculates and prints the sum of all the elements in the array using a for loop.
     let results = 0 

let numberArray1 =  [2,1,2,2,1,6]
for ( i = 0; )







// Stretch: Element counter
// Create an array of numbers
// Prompt the user for a number and write a for loop that tracks how many times that number is in the array
// e.g. 5 for [5, 1, 2, 5] --> 2
let numbrs = [2,9,8,6,1,3]
